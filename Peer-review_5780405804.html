All pages have the inclusion of contributors at the base of the page.   </li></ol></li></ol><p>Peer reviewers cannot be Content Editors (i.e. not part of Editorial team); they can be selected from the Editorial Board; they can be author nominated.</p><p>At a minimum, a page requires two reviewers.</p><p>After the page has been subjected to review (external or internal) and page authors have addressed reviewer comments, the Editorial Board can approve the creation of a stand-alone PDF document.
